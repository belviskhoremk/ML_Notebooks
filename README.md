# 🧠 Machine Learning Notebooks Collection

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks that explore key concepts in machine learning, such as logistic regression, regularization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and more. Each notebook is designed to explain core ideas through practical examples and datasets.

## 📘 Notebooks Included

| Notebook | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Brest_Cancer_Classification_Using_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` | Uses logistic regression to classify malignant and benign tumors from the breast cancer dataset. |
| `Regularization_on_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` | Demonstrates how L1 and L2 regularization affect logistic regression performance and overfitting. |
| `Kmeans_on_Breast_Cancer_Dataset.ipynb` | Applies the K-means clustering algorithm on the breast cancer dataset for unsupervised learning. |
| `PCA.ipynb` | Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualizes the results. |
| `Calculate_Bias_and_Variance.ipynb` | Shows how to compute and interpret bias and variance in machine learning models. |
| `TV_marketing_price_prediction_with_LR.ipynb` | Builds a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertising budget. |

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves both as:

- A personal learning portfolio of core ML concepts
- A helpful resource for beginners seeking real code examples

Each notebook is written to be **clear**, **practical**, and **self-contained**, with explanations embedded alongside the code.

## 🔗 How to Use

You can run these notebooks directly in your browser using:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Jupyter Notebook (locally via `jupyter notebook` or JupyterLab)

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add more models (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, etc.)
- Integrate model evaluation metrics
- Improve visualizations
